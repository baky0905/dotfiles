sudo sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- -b /usr/local/bin

This dotfiles repository is currently aimed for [**Ubuntu on WSL**](https://ubuntu.com/wsl)

Managed with [`chezmoi`](https://chezmoi.io), a great dotfiles manager.

## Getting started

You can use the [convenience script](./scripts/install_dotfiles.sh) to install the dotfiles on any machine with a single command. Simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sh -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baky0905/dotfiles/HEAD/scripts/install_dotfiles.sh)"
```

> ðŸ’¡ We use `wget` here because it comes preinstalled with most Ubuntu versions. But you can also use `curl`:
>
> ```bash
>  sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baky0905/dotfiles/HEAD/scripts/install_dotfiles.sh)"
> ```


### Convenience script

The [getting started](#getting-started) step used the [convenience script](./scripts/install_dotfiles.sh) to install this dotfiles. There are some extra options that you can use to tweak the installation if you need.

It supports some environment variables:

- `DOTFILES_REPO_HOST`: Defaults to `https://github.com`.
- `DOTFILES_USER`: Defaults to `baky0905`.
- `DOTFILES_BRANCH`: Defaults to `main`.

For example, you can use it to clone and install the dotfiles repository at the `beta` branch with:

```console
DOTFILES_BRANCH=beta sh -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baky0905/dotfiles/HEAD/scripts/install_dotfiles.sh)"
```

### Installing without the convenience script

If you prefer not to use the convenience script to install the dotfiles, you can also do it manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/baky0905/dotfiles "$HOME/.dotfiles"

"$HOME/.dotfiles/install.sh"
```
